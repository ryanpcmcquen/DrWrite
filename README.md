# DrWrite

![DrWrite_logo](./DrWrite_logo.png)

An online editor for your Dropbox files, with support for Markdown, Org Mode, and good ol' plain text.

-   This app is fully client side.
-   This app is as minimal as possible. It should work well on desktop and mobile, but the idea here is not to be the 'next great editor', the idea is to have a way to quickly edit Markdown and Org Mode files without a lot of fuss or distraction.
